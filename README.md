ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Terry
ðŸŒ± Despite not having the choice of taking computer science (CS) at school in my junior and senior years, I am currently exploring the field of CS on my own time! Within my repositories you will find some of my personal projets (e.g web-development, discord bots, machine learning...) , LeetCode problems that I enjoy trying from time to time, some CCC contest solutions, and other programs that I've worked on!
