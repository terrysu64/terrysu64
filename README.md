- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Terry
- ðŸŒ± Though not having the choice of taking CS at school in my junior and senior years, I am currently exploring the field of CS on my own time! Within my repositories you will find some of my personal contest solutions (i.e CCC), LeetCode problems that I enjoy trying from time to time, small projects, and other programs that I've worked on!
